GHCR_TOKEN: A GitHub Personal Access Token with write:packages and read:packages scopes.

KUBE_CONFIG: Base64-encoded Kubernetes configuration file content.

TRIVY_TOKEN: (Optional) Token for Trivy if required for private repositories.

üì¶ Docker Image Management
The Dockerfile defines the steps to build the application's Docker image. The CI/CD pipeline automates the building and pushing of this image to GitHub's Container Registry.
DEV Community

‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Deployment
The k8s/deployment.yaml file contains the Kubernetes deployment configuration. The CI/CD pipeline applies this configuration to update the application deployment in the Kubernetes cluster.

üìÑ Summary
This repository exemplifies a robust CI/CD setup for a Node.js microservice, integrating best practices for code quality, testing, containerization, security, and deployment. By leveraging GitHub Actions, Docker, Trivy, and Kubernetes, it provides an automated and efficient workflow for modern application development and deployment.
